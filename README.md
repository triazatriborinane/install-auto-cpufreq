# install-auto-cpufreq

A bad install script for the amazing [auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq) utility.

Use `curl` to run the script:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triazatriborinane/install-auto-cpufreq/main/install-auto-cpufreq.sh | sh
```

or just copy the script into a shell.

* Only works for Debian and its derivatives (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.) for now.
* Requires sudo

I just made this for my convenience, use it at your own risk.
